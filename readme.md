Video Rental Store API

## Getting started

Example of **.env** file, do not use the same password in production.

    DB_HOST=db
    DB_NAME=videostore
    DB_USER=videostore
    DB_PASS=videostore
    DB_PORT=5432
    SECRET=mysecret

For deploying the server you must have **docker** and **docker-compose** installed.

    docker-compose build && docker-compose run

Now the API is served on localhost:3000.
